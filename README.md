# Algorithms-Exploration---Cubing-Workflow

## Expierence:
#### Before this, I have tried the 3x3, and it was pretty hard to solve at first. However, the more I practiced the better I got. I have solved it a couple times but it took me around 15 minutes to solve the cube. For this Project "Algorithms Exploration-Cubing Workflow" I will be trying to learn how to solve the Pyramix puzzle.

## What is a Pyramix?
#### The Pyraminx is a regular tetrahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. It was made and patented by Uwe MÃ¨ffert after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by Erno Rubik, and introduced by Tomy Toys of Japan in 1981.

## Ways of solving:
#### To learn how to solve the Pyramix I used this video as a guide:

#### Also, I have learned that there are 3 different situations that you can end up in, and they are:
- Flipped two edges.
- Cycle three edges left side and right side.
- Weird Case left side and right side.
### How to solve the cube in these situations?
#### Flipped two edges:
L R' L' R U' R U R'

#### Cycle three edges left and right side:

##### Left: R U R' U R U R

##### Right: R U' R' U' R U' R'

#### Weird Cases left and right side:

##### Left: R' U' L' U L R

##### Right: L U R U' R' L'

## Time avarage:
<p>I solved the cube 3 times and my avarge time is around 1 minute and 30 seconds and I recorded these on 11/12/2020 </p>

## Thoughts:
<p>Personally, it was really fun to learn and to solve the cube was very accomplishing. I am considering of buying a cube, not sure which one yet, and not sure from where. But I think that it is very fun to learn how solve one and it could also be a fun fidgeting object. I would reccomend this cube to anyone beccause it is very cool looking and pretty easy to learn how to solve.</p>
