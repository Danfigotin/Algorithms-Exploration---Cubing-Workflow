# Algorithms-Exploration---Cubing-Workflow

## Expierence:
#### Before this, I have tried the 3x3, and it was pretty hard to solve at first. However, the more I practiced the better I got. I have solved it a couple times but it took me around half-hour to solve the cube. For this Project "Algorithms Exploration-Cubing Workflow" I will be trying to learn how to solve the Pyramix puzzle.
