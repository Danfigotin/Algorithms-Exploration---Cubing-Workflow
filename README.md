# Algorithms-Exploration---Cubing-Workflow

## Expierence:
#### Before this, I have tried the 3x3, and it was pretty hard to solve at first. However, the more I practiced the better I got. I have solved it a couple times but it took me around half-hour to solve the cube. For this Project "Algorithms Exploration-Cubing Workflow" I will be trying to learn how to solve the Pyramix puzzle.

## What is a Pyramix?
#### The Pyraminx is a regular tetrahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. It was made and patented by Uwe MÃ¨ffert after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by Erno Rubik, and introduced by Tomy Toys of Japan in 1981.
